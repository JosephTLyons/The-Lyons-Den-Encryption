# The-Lyons-Den-Encryption
GUI VERSION - This is a text encryption app I wrote using the JUCE library, the Projucer, and Xcode. The actual text encryption algorithm / functions were written a year ago as part of a command line version, but I re-wrote them to work with the GUI version. Still needs some code clean up and I'm sure that the GUI code is entirely correct.
